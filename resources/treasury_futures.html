<h1>Treasury Futures</h1>
<p>
  Treasury futures are standardized contracts traded on futures exchanges with
  Treasury securities as underlying assets. By using Treasury futures, banks can
  hedge against potential adverse movements in interest rates, thereby
  stabilizing their financial position and ensuring more predictable cash flows.
</p>
<!-- <h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
  Banks hold significant amounts of interest rate-sensitive assets and
  liabilities. Fluctuations in interest rates can impact the value of these
  holdings and the bank's net interest margin. Treasury futures help mitigate
  this risk in the following ways:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Hedging Assets:</strong> Banks can use Treasury futures to hedge the
    interest rate risk associated with their portfolio of fixed-income
    securities. For example, if a bank holds a substantial amount of 10-year
    Treasury notes, it can sell 10-year Treasury futures to offset potential
    losses from a rise in interest rates.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Hedging Liabilities:</strong> Similarly, banks can hedge their
    interest rate-sensitive liabilities. If a bank anticipates rising interest
    rates, it can buy Treasury futures to protect against higher borrowing costs
    associated with its floating-rate debt.
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Managing Duration Gap</h3>
<p>
  The duration gap measures the sensitivity of a bank's assets and liabilities
  to changes in interest rates. Treasury futures can help manage this gap by
  allowing banks to adjust the duration of their portfolios. For example, if a
  bank's assets have a longer duration than its liabilities, it can use Treasury
  futures to shorten the duration of its asset portfolio, reducing interest rate
  risk.

  <strong>Note:</strong> The deliverable maturity refers to the remaining
  maturity of the Treasury security delivered to settle the futures contract
  when it matures. In practice, a range of maturities are allowed. In this
  simulation, deliverable maturity matches exactly the underlying.
</p>

<h2>Contract Specifications</h2>

<p>
  Treasury futures have a <strong>quarterly cycle</strong> with expiration
  months in March, June, September, and December. For each type of Treasury
  futures, there are always four contracts trading simultaneously, each
  corresponding to one of the quarterly expiration months.
</p>

<p>
  As an example, suppose it is January 2024, the trading contracts are for March
  2024, June 2024, September 2024, and December 2024. When the March 2024
  contract approaches expiration, a new March 2025 contract will begin trading.
</p>

<p>
  This means the maturity of each contract is typically less than a year. As one
  contract nears expiration, positions will need to be rolled into the next
  available contract to maintain continuous hedging against interest rate
  movements.
