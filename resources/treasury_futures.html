<h1>Treasury Futures</h1>
<p>
  Treasury futures are standardized contracts traded on futures exchanges with
  Treasury securities as underlying assets. By using Treasury futures, banks can
  hedge against potential adverse movements in interest rates, thereby
  stabilizing their financial position and ensuring more predictable cash flows.
</p>
<!-- <h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
  Banks hold significant amounts of interest rate-sensitive assets and
  liabilities. Fluctuations in interest rates can impact the value of these
  holdings and the bank's net interest margin. Treasury futures help mitigate
  this risk in the following ways:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Hedging Assets:</strong> Banks can use Treasury futures to hedge the
    interest rate risk associated with their portfolio of fixed-income
    securities. For example, if a bank holds a substantial amount of 10-year
    Treasury notes, it can sell 10-year Treasury futures to offset potential
    losses from a rise in interest rates.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Hedging Liabilities:</strong> Similarly, banks can hedge their
    interest rate-sensitive liabilities. If a bank anticipates rising interest
    rates, it can buy Treasury futures to protect against higher borrowing costs
    associated with its floating-rate debt.
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Managing Duration Gap</h3>
<p>
  The duration gap measures the sensitivity of a bank's assets and liabilities
  to changes in interest rates. Treasury futures can help manage this gap by
  allowing banks to adjust the duration of their portfolios. For example, if a
  bank's assets have a longer duration than its liabilities, it can use Treasury
  futures to shorten the duration of its asset portfolio, reducing interest rate
  risk.
